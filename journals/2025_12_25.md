		- Config at `/etc/selinux`
		- File into with `ls -Z` #Doubt
		- Change file content
			- `chcon`
				- `-v`
				- `--type=TYPE`
					- `httpd_sys_content`
					- Type can be found in `seinfo -t`
			- `restorecon`: Restore original context
			- Users can be found in `seinfo -u`
			- Rolescan be found in `seinfo -r`
			- `seinfo`
				- Current policy context
			- For permanent change
				- `semanage -a -t httpd -t TYPE FILE`
		- Some important packages `setools policycoreutils setroubleshoot`
		- Process Context
			- Can be found with `ps -aZ`
			- Get running programs
				- `semanage login -l`: Get login programs #Doubt
		- SELinux Policy Violation #Doubt
		- SELinux setings(SEBool)
			- Get with `getsebool -a`
			- Set with `setsebool -P RULE STATE`
			- Get better view with `semanage boolean -l`
- Cloud Computing #Cloud
	- Vertical Scaling: Increasing power
	- Horizontal Scaling: Buying more hardware
	- Providing _Computational Power, Storage, Database, Networking_ over the internet with _Pay as You Go_ model
		- Scalable flexible Powers and Storages
		- Quick to setup
		- Provides better reliability
		- Easier to manage
	- Owned Server challenges(On Premise)
		- More control
		- Security
		- Very expensive to scale
		- Traffic increase needs more servers which are expensive
		- Small but high peak in traffic creates excess capacity
	- Variants #Doubt
