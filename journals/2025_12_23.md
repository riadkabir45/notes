- Files and permissions #Light #Unix
	- Directory only allows `cd` if its has execution permission
	- Permissions are in order `rwx` with value `421`
	- File linking
		- Symbolic link is extra file pointing to the main file. Depends on main file
		- Hard link is actual reference to the main file and does not depend on other reference. Hard link also has sync data attribute across references
	- `tar FILE_NAME FILES`
		- `z`: Compresses using gzip
		- `c`: create
		- `f`: File instead of tape
		- `v`: Verbose mode
- Shell #Light #Unix
	- `!command`: Runs last command that started with the `command`
	- `$SHELL`: Points to running shell
	- `Ctrl+Z`: Sends program to background
	- `find DIRECTORY`
		- `-perm`: Look for permissions
		- `atime`: Accessed in `n` days
		- `anewer`: Accessed after date of provided file
		- `cnewer`: Changed after date of provided file
	- Quotation Stops shell from expanding things like REGEX

- Prompt Engineering #Light #LLM #NeuralNet #AI
	- Chapter 1
		- Base LLM: A llm trained on large dataset for general purpose next word predection
		- Instruction Tuned LLM: A base llm fine tuned to give specific styled reply
			- Fine tuned typically with _Reinforcement Learning With Human Feedback_(RLHF)
	- Chapter 2
		- Basic Prompt Principals
			- Write clear, detailed and structured instructions
				- Use delimiters to structure the prompt and separate sections
				- If needed, give model an example of output structure
				- Specify what to do if certain event happened during thinking like the input did not have enough steps f
				- Give successful examples of answer known as _Few Shot Prompting_
			- Give model time to think
