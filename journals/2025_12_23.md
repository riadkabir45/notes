- Files and permissions #Light #Unix
	- Directory only allows `cd` if its has execution permission
	- Permissions are in order `rwx` with value `421`
	- File linking
		- Symbolic link is extra file pointing to the main file. Depends on main file
		- Hard link is actual reference to the main file and does not depend on other reference. Hard link also has sync data attribute across references
	- `tar FILE_NAME FILES`
		- `z`: Compresses using gzip
		- `c`: create
		- `f`: File instead of tape
		- `v`: Verbose mode

	- `$SHELL`: Points to running shell
	- `Ctrl+Z`: Sends program to background
	- `find DIRECTORY`
