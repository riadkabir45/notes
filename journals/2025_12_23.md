- Unix and Linux #Light #Unix
	- Files and permissions
		- Directory only allows `cd` if its has execution permission
		- Permissions are in order `rwx` with value `421`
		- File linking #Doubt
			- Symbolic link is extra file pointing to the main file. Depends on main file
			- Hard link is actual reference to the main file and does not depend on other reference. Hard link also has sync data attribute across references
		- `tar FILE_NAME FILES`
			- `z`: Compresses using gzip
			- `c`: create
			- `f`: File instead of tape
			- `v`: Verbose mode
	- Shell #Light #Unix
		- `!command`: Runs last command that started with the `command`
		- `$SHELL`: Points to running shell
		- `Ctrl+Z`: Sends program to background
		- `find DIRECTORY`
			- `-perm`: Look for permissions
			- `-atime`: Accessed in `n` days
			- `-anewer`: Accessed after date of provided file
			- `-cnewer`: Changed after date of provided file
		- Quotation Stops shell from expanding things like REGEX
		- There's mount related video at 4:16 #Doubt
		- `man [section] topic`: Section opens up specific section of huge manpages
	- Booting and Logging
		- `init`: Interaction with the init process
			- `0`: Calls for shutdown
			- `6`: Calls for reboot
		- RunLevel
			- `/etc/inittab`: Set up default runlevel
				- `0-5` are in order `halt, single user, basic multi user, full multi user, unused , x11, reboot`
				- Do not set `halt, reboot` as default runlevel
			- `/etc/rc.d`: Contains script to be run at different run level
				- Each level folder is named `rc0.d,rc1.d..`
				- Scripts with K at start are run at shutdown while S starts at boot
		- `/var/log`
			- `messages`: Stores program messages
			- `boot.log`: Stores boot logs
			- `dmesg`: Kernel and driver logs
			- `secure`: Stores auth logs
			- `maillog`: Mail server logs
		- `/etc/rsyslog.conf`
			- Set log rules and file locations
			- Set up log listener or sender
		- `kll [-SIGNAL] PID`
			- `9`: Kill signal
		- Service
			- IP Table: Linux Default firewall
			- `chkconfig SERVICE COMMAND`: Configures service scripts
				- `--add`: Add script
				- `--del`: Remove script
				- `--level`: Target specific run levels

- Prompt Engineering #Light #LLM
	- Chapter 1
		- Base LLM: A llm trained on large dataset for general purpose next word predection
		- Instruction Tuned LLM: A base llm fine tuned to give specific styled reply
			- Fine tuned typically with _Reinforcement Learning With Human Feedback_ (RLHF)
	- Chapter 2
		- Basic Prompt Principals
			- Write clear, detailed and structured instructions
				- Use delimiters to structure the prompt and separate sections
				- If needed, give model an example of output structure
				- Specify what to do if certain event happened during thinking like the input did not have enough steps f
				- Give successful examples of answer known as _Few Shot Prompting_
			- Give model time to think
				- Specify each step to complete the task
				- Tell the model to reason out its own answer for more accuracy
				- Impose limit or rule on the model. Like find relevant information about a data first. Than answer biased on it _(To Prevent Hallucinations)_
	- Chapter 3
		- Iterative Prompt Development
			- Get a prompt idea
			- Test out the idea prompt
			- Figure out what went wrong
			- Repeat
	- Chapter 4
		- Inferring
			- Extract compact information or statement from large text
	- Chapter 5
		- Temperature
			- Models creativity limit. Lower value limits model tightly to reasoning and rules
	- Chapter 6
		- Chatbot message structure
			- System message: Placed at begin of conversation unknown to user. Used to shape AI response
			- User and AI messages: Rest of the list contains conversation between user and agent to have message history
			- More efficient ways
				- Full chat history
					- Full accurate context memory
					- Exponential token footprint
				- Sliding window:
					- Smaller token footprint
					- Limited accurate memory
				- Conversation Summarization
					- Very small token footprint
					- Loses context of not important facts
				- VectorDB
					- Very efficient while having small token footprint
					- Requires setup VectorDB
