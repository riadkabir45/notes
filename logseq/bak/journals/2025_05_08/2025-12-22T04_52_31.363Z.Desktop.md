	- Abstract
		- This paper comprehensively assesses the application of active learning strategies to enhance
		  natural language processing-based optical character recognition (OCR) models for image-to-LaTeX conversion. It addresses the existing limitations of OCR models and proposes innovative practices to strengthen their accuracy. Key components of this study include the augmentation of training data with LaTeX syntax constraints, the integration of active learning strategies, and the employment of active learning feedback loops. This paper first examines the current weaknesses of OCR models with a particular focus on symbol recognition, complex equation handling, and noise moderation. These limitations serve as a framework against which the subsequent research methodologies are assessed. Augmenting the training data with LaTeX syntax constraints is a crucial strategy for improving model precision. Incorporating symbol relationships, wherein contextual information is considered during recognition, further enriches the error correction. This paper critically examines the application of active learning strategies. The active learning feedback loop leads to progressive improvements in accuracy. This article underlines the importance of uncertainty and diversity sampling in sample selection, ensuring that the dynamic learning process remains efficient and effective. Appropriate evaluation metrics and ensemble techniques are used to improve the operational learning effectiveness of the OCR model. These techniques allow the model to adapt and perform more effectively in diverse application domains, further extending its utility.
	- Problem
		- The digitization of mathematical documents is very complex due to various types of complex symbols and notations that look very similar. So a traditional OCR cannot accurately convert a hand written document of this type into digital document. Converting that to LaTex is another challenge. CNNs and RNNs may struggle with out-of-domain and rare symbols.
	- Solution
		- A complex NLP that adheres to LaTeX syntax, ensuring the output is always correct.
	- Dataset
		- CROHME dataset containing handwritten mathematical expressions  image-to-LaTeX conversion
		- The MathML and LaTeX dataset (MALL)
